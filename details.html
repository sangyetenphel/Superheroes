        <h1>Iron Man</h1>
        <p>Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man, is a billionaire industrialist and genius inventor who transforms himself into a technological superhero after a life-changing experience. While demonstrating his company's weapons in a war zone, Stark is critically injured by his own munitions and captured by terrorists. Instead of building weapons for his captors, he secretly constructs a powerful suit of armor equipped with weapons and flight capabilities, using it not only to escape but to dedicate his life to protecting the world as Iron Man.</p>

        <p>What sets Iron Man apart is that he has no superhuman powers – his abilities come entirely from his intellect and the sophisticated powered armor suits he designs and builds. The Iron Man armor grants him superhuman strength, flight capabilities, repulsor blasts, an array of weapons, and advanced shielding. Over the years, Stark has created dozens of specialized armor models, each more advanced than the last, ranging from the classic red and gold Mark suits to specialized armors like the Hulkbuster and space variants.</p>

        <p>Despite his heroic actions, Stark grapples with significant personal flaws, including arrogance, alcoholism, and a tendency to act impulsively. His complicated relationships with fellow Avengers, particularly Captain America, often stem from his belief that technology and control can solve any problem. Yet beneath his brash exterior lies a deeply moral man haunted by the destructive legacy of his weapons manufacturing past, who continually strives to redeem himself by using his genius to make the world a better and safer place.</p>
